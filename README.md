# Humpback-Whale-Identification
CPE 695 Final Project
In the public kernel, the author suggests using local machine since Kaggle only supports 6 hours GPU but each training process needs several days. So we developed our implementation locally. When we finished our project locally, we tried to write a kaggle kernel using our local files and data but it failed. So now we have to upload our files here. If you have any questions please contact us.

In this repository, we uploaded our main.py, ensemble.py, model training log, our best single model and our final ensemble csv file.
